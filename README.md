# PyAutoClicker
This is an auto clicker I made with python.

# How to use
To run the program, you first must open terminal. If you're using bash, navigate to the file with the cd command.

`$: cd Terminal-Auto-clicker`
To run, you need to use the `python3` command. If you do not have that command, do the following:

`$: sudo apt install python3`

finally, after getting python 3, run the file with this command:

```$: python3 path/to/file/auto_clicker.py```

after that, just follow the directions on screen, and to stop, move your mouse to the top left of your screen.
